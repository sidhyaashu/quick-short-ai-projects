Here's a complete **step-by-step guide** to:

1. 🏗️ **Set up your Conda environment**
2. 🛠️ **Install required packages**
3. 🧠 **Run your LangChain + Ollama Q&A app in VS Code**

Perfect for first-time setup! Let's go 👇

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Install Conda (if not already)

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you don’t have it.

To verify:
```bash
conda --version
```

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Create a New Conda Environment

### ▶️ Basic command (no packages yet)
```bash
conda create --name myqnaenv
```

### ▶️ With Python + packages
```bash
conda create --name myqnaenv python=3.11
```

Then activate it:

```bash
conda activate myqnaenv
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Create `requirements.txt`

Create a file called `requirements.txt` in your project folder with the following content:

```txt
langchain
langchain-ollama
langchain-chroma
```

---

## 📥 Step 4: Install Python Packages

Make sure you're in your Conda environment, then install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 💡 Note: `langchain-ollama` requires Ollama to be installed and running locally.

---

## 🧠 Step 5: (Optional) Install Ollama & a Model

If not already installed:
```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Start it and pull a model:
```bash
ollama run llama3
```

---

## 🖥️ Step 6: Open Project in VS Code

1. Launch VS Code
2. Open your project folder
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
4. Run: `Python: Select Interpreter`
5. Choose one that includes `(conda) myqnaenv` or `Anaconda3/envs/myqnaenv`

---

## 👀 Step 7: Confirm the Terminal is Using Conda

Go to **View → Terminal** or press:  
`` Ctrl+` ``  
You should see something like:

```bash
(myqnaenv) user@machine:~/your-folder$
```

This confirms you’re using the correct environment in VS Code.

---

## 🚀 Step 8: Run Your LangChain + Ollama Q&A App

Make sure you have:
- `x.csv` (with your Q&A data)
- `vector.py` and `main.py` (from earlier steps)

Then, in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ask your questions like:

```
Question: What is the capital of France?
```

or

```
Question: Who is Asutosh?
```

---

## ✅ Done! You’re Live!

You're now running a **local retrieval-augmented chatbot** using:
- Conda + Python
- LangChain
- Ollama (local LLM)
- Chroma vector store
- Your custom CSV knowledge
